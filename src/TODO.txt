Current list of things to fix/add to iperf 3.0

-  (-i N) mode on server does not work (bus error)
-  add sanity checks on -l, -i, -t, -n, and -w options
-  separate iperf_api.c into iperf_client.c and iperf_utils.c 
-  verify placment of all timing calls and total_bytes_sent computations
-  look for 'XXX' in code and address
-  add -v (version)
-  much better/standard error handling throughout
-  better packaging/makefile, README, LICENCE, etc files
-  finish/fix receive_result_from_server()
      - should this be called for TCP too, or only UDP (currently its both,
              but I think it should be UDP only, or maybe a command line option for TCP
-  document and verify the 'state machine'. Is it an error to send messages in the wrong order?
     - e.g.: what is "STREAM_RUNNING" vs "TEST_RUNNING"??
-  cleanup/fix/test UDP mode
-  add verbose and debug options
-  add human readable vs machine readable output mode
     (my idea on this is that "human readable" = compatable with old iperf,
     and that "machine readable is all name=value pairs -blt )
-  add IPV6
-  lots more testing
-  add daemon mode (-D)
-  see issue tracker for other wish list items
